# Contribution  
If you want to contribute to this project, you can help me out by making the JSONObjectFromString class less buggy because I'm confused on how I will make it properly, you can also add features, and patch bugs.  
Just submit a pull request with your new code to add and I will merge it if it looks fine.  
  
# Naming  
I like to name Ziph builds like this: `ZiphJSON-v(major).(minor).(patch)-(state).jar`  
`(major)`, `(minor)`, and `(patch)` is semantic versioning (check <a href="https://semver.org">this</a> if you don't know what's semantic versioning)  
`(state)` can be 3 values, either `alpha`, `beta`, or `stable`
